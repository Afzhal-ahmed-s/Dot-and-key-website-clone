> Dot & Key is focused on providing a range of skincare so solutions. It offers premium skincare products such as serums, face masks, toners and cleansers. The brand recently expanded into nutraceuticals. The Indian unicorn Nykaa has now acquired dot and key.


Myself and my team of 6 members have cloned the Dot and key website as project of our construct week at** Masai School**.
